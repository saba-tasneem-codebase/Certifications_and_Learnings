# 🚀 Hey, I'm Saba!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where curiosity meets code, dashboards, and data magic.  
I’m someone who enjoys turning raw data into meaningful insights, automating the boring stuff with scripts, and occasionally having deep conversations with AI tools. 📊💡🤖

This repo is where I document the journey — certifications, projects, and learnings that help me grow as a developer, analyst, and lifelong learner.
